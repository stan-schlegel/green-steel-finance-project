# Stegra Green Steel – RSM Impact Investing WHU Project (2025)

**Role:** Financial Lead & Project Co-Author  
**Institution:** WHU – Otto Beisheim School of Management  
**Domain:** Sustainable Infrastructure Finance & Project Valuation  
**Model Type:** Multi-Scenario DCF + IRR Simulation + Bankability Testing  

This repository contains the financial model and supporting documentation developed for the WHU capstone project **“Stegra Green Steel”**, a €5.5B hydrogen-based steel plant targeting Europe’s first *bankable* green steel production.

The project assesses commercial feasibility, ESG impact, capital structure optimization, and resilience to regulatory and market uncertainty.
